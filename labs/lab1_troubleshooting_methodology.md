# Lab 1 — Troubleshooting Methodology

**Goal:** Practice the A+ flow: identify → theory → test → plan → verify → document.

**Scenario:** PC powers on, fans spin, but shows “No boot device available.”

## Your Tasks
- Identify: Write 3 useful questions you’d ask the user.
- Theory: List 2–3 likely causes.
- Test: What will you test first (and how)?
- Plan & Fix: What did you do to try to fix it?
- Verify: Did it work? If not, next step?

## Evidence
- Screenshot of BIOS/UEFI storage page → `assets/screenshots/lab1_bios_storage.png`

## Reflection (2–3 sentences)
What changed from your first guess to the actual fix?
