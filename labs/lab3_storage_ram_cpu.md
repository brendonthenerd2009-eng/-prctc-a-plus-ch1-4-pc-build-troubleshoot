# Lab 3 — System Devices (Storage, RAM, CPU & Cooling)

**Goal:** Install storage (SATA or NVMe), seat RAM correctly, and confirm temps.

## Steps
- Storage: Install SATA SSD/HDD (data+power) or NVMe drive; confirm UEFI detects it
- RAM: Seat in correct channels (e.g., A2/B2). Confirm total GB in UEFI
- CPU/Cooler: Correct orientation; small “pea” thermal; CPU_FAN header connected
- Boot to UEFI and check CPU idle temp looks normal

## Evidence
- RAM installed photo → `assets/screenshots/lab3_ram_slots.jpg`
- Storage installed photo → `assets/screenshots/lab3_storage.jpg`

## (Optional) Inventory Output
- Save a text file describing CPU, RAM, Disks (use scripts in Step 5) → `labs/outputs/inventory.txt`

## Notes
Anything unexpected? Write it down here.
