# Lab 4 — BIOS/UEFI, Boot Order, Diagnostics

**Goal:** Understand boot order, Secure Boot, and basic drive health checks.

## Steps
- UEFI tour: record version/date; note boot order
- Secure Boot: find it; record ON/OFF state; toggle once; confirm it “sticks”
- SMART health: run a basic disk health check (Windows or Linux)

## Evidence
- Screenshot of Secure Boot page → `assets/screenshots/lab4_secure_boot.png`
- SMART status text → `labs/outputs/smart_health.txt`
